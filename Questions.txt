For Instructor
1. How can I mutate and replace column without giving it a new name and then dropping the old column (ie score to score_val)
2. Should I defer to .csv files instead of .xlsx for increased compatability?
3. How to do self join, like to get prior hole score for bounceback %


For Data
1. is bounceback % interesting to look at?
2. do players play differently on final day?


For Self
1. look at fuzzyjoin package later for logical condition joins
